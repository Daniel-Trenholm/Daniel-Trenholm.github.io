            Dog Shit Vol #7: A tail of steaming love
        </h1>
		<br>
		<p> 
			I smelled it before I saw it. A Wind Bear. Carrying the stench of dogshit.
		<br>
Knowing what I was about to be forced into I made a run for it. I leapt over a piece of moldy cheese with little green hairs and somersaulted into the cave. Without waiting for my eyes to adjust to the darkness I ventured forward. Shuddering, my hands brushed something warm, fleshy, and moist. Eachother.
<br>
Just to be sure, I smelled them. Yup, just like expired swiss guerer. The delectable stench made me second guess myself. Should I turn back, face the Wind Bear, and recover my cherished cheese? Or would it be better to run headlong into the gaping chasm ahead?
<br>
Giving each finger a lick, slurp slurp pop, I turned around, cracked my knuckles, and prepared for a fight.
<br>
“Alright you overgrown wanna be dog. I ain’t running without getting back that cheese.”
<br>
It stared at me with narrowed, violet eyes. Removing my aviators I started back. Hands clenched. Feet planted. Gun cocked.
<br>
“Where did the Wind Bear get a gun,” you say.
<br>
Amazon.com
<br>
$13.99 + HST. It was on sale. Damn, if only I followed up on the deal too. Gonna have to settle this one with words.
<br>
“Hey, have you heard that song <i>How To Skin a Cat</i> by Husker Du?”
<br>
“Grrawwwe!” (Yeah)
<br>
“Yeah I liked it too. Reminds me of how to skin a cat. Those were the days...”
<br>
“Growwwaww Grr.” (Oh? I see you fought in ‘Nam too. Myself, I was a lieutenant. Would have been promoted too, except for that one time I was shot. Thanks for bringing up those memories, kid. Ahh the war crimes. Those millennials don’t know how good they got it. How much we sacrificed for them. The ungrateful bastards.)
<br>
While the Wind Bear was Monologuing I made my move. With a running start I leapt over him, but the cave ceiling was too short.
<br>
<b>KERMUNCH</b>.
<br>
My 2 foot diameter (60.96 cm) helmet dropped to the ground, now ground itself.
<br>
“Snarl?” (Snarl?)
<br>
The Wind Bear was confused. As any Wind Bear would be. It is little known, but Wind Bears don’t believe in jumping.
<br>
And so, it seemed that with a single leap I had defeated this particularly fearsome Bear of Wind.
<br>
As is standard, he vanished into a poof of purple particles.
<br>
My shoulders dropped. Sighing, I stepped towards the cave entrance. Sitting there, in all it’s pristine beauty, was the swiss guerer.
<br>
Steaming in the sun, the green hairs shimmered with iridescent glossy gloss. An ant was crawling atop a newly formed mushroom sprouting from one of the holes.
<br>
My saliva must’ve fertilized that spot from the last bite I took.
<br>
The wind shifted, and I was enveloped in a delicious blanket of fermented probiotic cultures.
<br>
My eyes lit up. “Chow Time!”
<br>
As if in a cinematic sequence I bounded towards my unrequited love. But my enthusiasm was too much. I tripped over the steering wheel of a fiery red 1964 chevy with leather bucket seats and barreled backasswards into the cheese.
<br>
My face was stricken with Horror. Why did the Wind Bear have to park its fiery red 1964 chevy with leather bucket seats in front of my cheese?
<br>
As my ear-wax green Shrek boxers came into contact with the cheese they dissolved and I felt my botoxed buttocks start to melt. It was then that I remembered.
<br>
Botox and mold make nitroglycerine.
<br>
As I approached the ground, my life flashed before my eyes: anime.
