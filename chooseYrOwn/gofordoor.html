            You walk towards the door, but are immediately <br>
            violently tugged back by the neck. <br>
            As you fall to the floor, a light turns on directly above you. <br>
            Looking around, it is clear that you are inside of a medium sized toolshed.
            With the help of the light, you can see that a lightswitch was 
            tied around your neck. <br><br>
