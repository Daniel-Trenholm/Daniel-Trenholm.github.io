            Dog Shit Vol #2: In a Season Of Crime
        </h1>
        <br>
        <p> Jesus stepped out of the building and put on his really big hat. It was a cowboy hat, and he was wearing a shirt with fringe that could stretch along for miles and miles. On his hands, he didn’t have any gloves but on his eyes were his spectacles that were really good for looking through.<br>
	He was waiting for an… Acquaintance of his, and he figured he’d be waiting for a while longer, so he pulled out his Nokia flip phone and started playing Brick Break. His high score was one of the highest in the world, and for that all his closest friends called him “Gamer Jesus”.<br>
<br>
    While thoroughly immersed in brick break, his new friend walked into the building and saw him there. It was Sans Undertale. Sans was dressed up for the occasion, wearing his usual Blue Jacket, Yeezy Slides and Cargo shorts, which featured 8 pockets, that were quite helpful if he’d wanted to fill his pockets with macaroons later when he’d go to the grocery store. <br>
Sans surveyed the room, looking for Jesus, and didn’t see him, so he whipped out his IPhone 7, and sent him a worried text saying “WTFAU?”, which stood for “Where the frick are you?”.<br>
<br>
Immediately after sending the text, Sans Undertale heard a loud, blaring sound coming from just outside the main lobby, it was Finger Eleven’s “Paralyzer”, blasting from Jesus’ phone. He quickly ran outside of the building and saw Jesus hunched over, with his phone tightely gripped in his hands. Sans strolled over to Jesus and tapped him on the back.<br>
<br>
Jesus turned around. “Is that you, Sans Undertale?”<br>
<br>
“Yes, it is me, Sans Undertale” said Sans Undertale, with his unmoving mouth stuck in a forced grin<br>
<br>
Jesus raised his hands above his head, and gave off a look of anger and extreme focus.<br>
	Jesus told Sans Undertale something through his focus that shook Mr Undertale all the way down to his bones: He said “You’ve ruined me, and for that you must perish!”. A death look in Jesus’ eyes showed Sans that he wasn’t messing around, and Sans knew that he would not live for much longer.<br>
	A blue glow started above Jesus’ head, and Sans Undertale there, stuck in fright, frantically searching the area for what could have caused this. He spotted a Banana Peel, a Giant Tube, and a Few Rusty needles, but none of those could have been the cause for this outrage. He searched more and more, with no success, until he spotted Jesus’ flip phone, open with a finished game of brick break on the screen. His score was 932,745,965,972,324 points, which Sans Undertale knew was just 1,000,000 points lower than the current world record. <br>
Sans Undertale understood now, that when he texted Jesus, his phone must’ve slowed down and made him miss the ball, which would’ve been the speed of a small meteorite by then.<br>
<br>
But it was too late; The glow (pt. 2) above Jesus’ head had grown to the size of a 6 square foot ball of cheese, and it glowed so strongly that it knocked out any and all passersby who happened to see it. <br>
It wouldn’t be long before Jesus made his move.<br>
<br>
Sans Undertale looked for any way out of this situation.<br>
He knew he had to live, because he still had a rehearsal the next day with his swing group in which he played the oboe, “Bone-Town”.<br>
After looking around for what felt like 2 seconds, he saw Ness Earthbound and he knew what he had to do.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Jesus had finished charging his third blue ball and said what he thought would be his final words to Sans Undertale, who stood there with an epic smirk on his face.<br>
“Hyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh. For disrupting the flow of brick break, you will now face a fate worse than death!” said Jesus. “You will be killed by my special move, and i’ll tell my dad that you’re not allowed in.”<br>
“aSDFGHJKLFDSRTYUYFDFVVBNMhOLYsPIRITbOMBSDFGHBVCVBNMIUydDfggXcvBn” said jesus, firing his giant blue ball at Sans Undertale.<br>
“I’ve been dunked on?” said Sans Undertale, as he was enveloped by a glowing blue light<br>
<br>
There was a big explosion and it blew up and everything exploded.<br>
<br>
When the dust settled, Jesus was standing on a 300m high precarious pillar, surrounding by a giant circular crater, which could’ve been 8-9 km wide. <br>
Everything and everyone on the inside of the crater was dead. Jesus, his pectoral muscles RIPPING through his fringe-covered shirt, hopped off the pillar to the ground below.<br>
He landed with a crunch of his legs, breaking a few bones, and cried out in pain. “AaaAaAaAaAaaAAAAaAaaAaUUUUUUUUuuuUUGgggGGGgGggGgHHhhhHhhhHh that FUCKING HURT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaAaaAaAaAaAaAAaAAAaaaaA”.<br>
He looked directly up into the sky, past the swirling clouds of dust, and said “hey dad can you fix my legs?”. A booming voice, echoing from all directions, so loud it would kill a firefly replied only a single word “Okay”. <br>
<br>
Jesus looked down at his legs, after hearing this timely response, smirked (like a boss), and trekked across the plain of rubble and skeletons. After walking for 16 minutes, Jesus saw  a Skeleton wrapped in robes of blue, and knew it was the dead body of Sans Undertale.<br>
<br>
“My Gamerhood has been preserved’ thought Jesus to himself, seeing the body lying there.<br>
Suddenly his stomach grumbled and he thought to himself “My o’my! I didn’t even notice that it’s already dinnertime, I suppose I might as well feast on the corpse of my enemy!”<br>
Jesus leaned over and snapped off a bone from the skeleton lying there, and started chewing on it.<br>
“!” exclaimed Jesus. “This taste just like sands undertal ebones, mmmpfh” <br>
<br>
AND THEN from the heaps of skeletons, a skeleton with similar form to that which jesus was eating rose to his feet.<br>
<br>
Jesus kept on feasting on what he thought was Sans Undertale.<br>
<br>
In a moment, the skeleton left standing teleported behind Jesus and sayed “Your gonna have a bad time”, then fucking cut his head off with a katana the size of mexico on a map.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Jesus died and was dead, and Sans Undertale watched his body fall to the ground, then expanded to 9876948543 times his regular size.<br>
He was the height of an average house, the width of a country, and angry beyond belief.<br>
He jumped out of the crater and took ten steps forward, crushing China, Japan, the Pacific Ocean, and Half of Canada.<br>
He stopped his murderous walk, noticing he was going the wrong way, and turned towards New York. <br>
A few more steps and he was there, his front end at the entrance to a graveyard. He searched his last search, looking for a certain tombstone, before he knew he would run out of energy and die.<br>
He found the tombstone, marked “John William Coltrane”, and laughed.<br>
<br>
He then screamed “I guess those were some giant steps, huh?” and died.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
40 Years Later…<br>
 <br>
“Finally, we have rebuilded the part of Nazi America that Sans Undertale destroyed in his plight against us.” Said Donnie Dumphy to the croud of millions, as he raised a cod fish to the sky. “Better yet, we’ve heard news that J-Lac’s troops have secured the remaining hostile group, meaning we are now finally in control of the entire world!”<br>
The entire crowd erupted in applause, knowing this meant they were finally free. Well, the entire crowd minus one…<br>
One soul didn’t clap, he didn’t cheer, he was having none of it. He watched the degenerates cheer, made stupider by the recent colony started on Jupiter by Space-D, and felt no pity. The man scowled and turned away from the crowd. He knew that the world would never be a happy place as long as the “Oppressive Nazis” party ruled.<br>
He then disappeared into a shadowy alleyway, holding the nuclear bomb button that would explode a nuclear bomb that was there.<br>
His name?<br>
Fred Figglehorn.<br>
 
The end.
