I wake up from a two hour nap after having a fantastic dream about a hamburger. The hamburger was a BLT with cheese; one for the best burgers I had in my life but my favorite part about the burger was not the bacon, not the cheese, not ever the mouthwatering patty, but it was the bun. Oh how that lightly toasted bun felt as my teeth sunk into it. My stomach started growling as I thought about the bread. "I gotta get some bread, I gotta get THAT bread" I thought to myself. I get my lazy ass off the couch and head to the kitchen. I pass my dog as she says "Oh, your awake, how was your nap?" I stop dead in my tracks and take a 180 to look at her dead in the eyes and say "Shut the kunk up" then go back on my mission for that bread. I get to the pantry and search each shelf for that bread but with no luck. How can we out of bread, who ate it all who took my bread?! I bust through the front door sprinting past my car head toward the nearest bread store. As 'm running the only thing going on in my mind is "Get that bread, get that bread, get that bread". The store is in my sight, I can almost taste that bread, I can almost feel the soft loaf in my mouth. My mouth is watering. I burst in and slam a five dollar bill on the counter. "gimme the bread". The cashier takes my money and tosses a loaf at my head. I grab it midair and start to devour it like that on video of the guy eating the watermelon. I got that bread.
